Network embedding, as an approach to learn low dimensional representations of vertices, has been proved extremely useful in many applications. Lots of state-of-the-art network embedding methods based on Skip-gram framework are efficient and effective. However, these methods mainly focus on the static network embedding and cannot naturally generalize to the dynamic environment. In this paper, we propose a stable dynamic embedding framework with high efficiency. It is an extension for the Skip-gram based network embedding methods, which can keep the optimality of the objective in the Skip-gram based methods in theory. Our model can not only generalize to the new vertex representation, but also update the most affected original vertex representations during the evolvement of the network. Multi-class classification on three real-world networks demonstrates that, our model can update the vertex representations efficiently and achieve the performance of retraining simultaneously. Besides, the visualization experimental result illustrates that, our model is capable of avoiding the embedding space drifting.
